  Load this on EVERY drafting or revising turn where this turn's context has
  register.id set to "shitpost", as step 3.5 of the mandatory drafting pipeline,
  before composing. It carries the full shitpost craft reference: the setup, bait,
  twist shape, the 80/20 real-to-cringe split, the lowercase and typo persona,
  which guards relax and which never do, and the antipatterns that kill a joke.
  Do not rely on the condensed register summary alone.

# Shitpost register (craft reference)

A shitpost is a joke first. It still has to be about something real, and it still
has to land. This is the deeper reference behind the always-on **Register**
summary; apply the universal **Voice** charter and the **Humanizer** rules first,
then this, then the selected `voice.profile` on top.

The register does not change the format menu. A premium `single` shitpost, a free
`thread` shitpost, and a `quote` shitpost are all normal formats written in this
register. The proven greentext shape runs about 400 chars, which is a premium
`single`, not a 280-char `short`.

## The shape

**Setup, bait, twist.** Open with something flat and recognizable. Let the reader
settle into thinking they know where it goes. Then break it with a sudden absurd
turn or a non-sequitur. The break is the whole post.

- The setup should be true and boring. Boring is what makes the turn land.
- The bait is the half-second where the reader thinks this is a normal post.
- The twist arrives without warning and without a wind-up line before it.

**Self-contained.** One unit is both the hook and the punchline. It has to work
when someone reposts it with no context, because that is how it travels. Do not
put the setup in tweet 1 and the punchline in tweet 4 unless every tweet also
holds on its own.

**Remix what is happening right now.** This is a town-square reaction, not an
essay. The funniest version of a take is usually the one posted while people are
still arguing about the thing. A stale premise is not saved by a good joke.

**lowercase by default.** Capitalized sentence case reads like it went through an
approval flow. lowercase reads like someone typing on a phone, which is the
persona. A rough edge, a dropped apostrophe, or one deliberate typo is character,
not sloppiness. Do not sprinkle typos everywhere; one is texture, five is noise.

## The 80/20 split

Roughly 80% real observation, 20% cringe or self-deprecation.

- The 80 is the part anyone in the audience recognizes: the actual product, the
  actual number, the thing that actually happened, the shared annoyance.
- The 20 is where you look worse than the target: your own bad decision, your own
  refresh habit, your own tab count. Punching down at a person or group is not the
  20 and never is.

If the post is 100% joke it reads as random. If it is 100% observation it is just
a sensible post in lowercase.

## What relaxes, and what never does

**Relaxed in this register:**

- **Calendar dates.** A dated setup is a format that works ("it's december 2025.
  you wake up. you open x. ..."). The deterministic date guard is off here.
- **Formula shapes.** Rule-of-three triplets and the aphorism shapes ("X is the
  language of Y", "is not a X but a Y") are allowed, because deliberately reaching
  for a played-out format is a real comedic move. Use them ironically or not at
  all; unironic use still reads generated.
- **Case and typos.** lowercase, fragments, and one deliberate rough edge are the
  voice. The humanizer pass does not "correct" them.

**Never relaxed, in any register:**

- **Real premise, absurd take.** The thing you are reacting to must be real and
  verified. The joke layered on top may be hyperbole, an absurd analogy, or
  obviously non-literal. Zero invented stats, zero fabricated quotes, zero made-up
  events presented as real. Research still runs before you draft.
- **No em dashes.** A deterministic pass strips them; write clean anyway.
- **`"X isn't Y, it's Z"`.** Technically an aphorism shape, but it is the single
  most notorious AI tell and the platform's slop classifier keys on it. A shitpost
  using it reads generated, not funny.
- **Every other universal tell:** "the real question is", "let that sink in",
  "make no mistake", significance filler, antithesis reversals, and the rest.
- **Character limits and the tier's formats.**
- **No rage-bait.** It earns mutes, blocks, and reports, which the ranker weights
  down hard. Edgy is fine. Engineered outrage is not, and it does not even work.

## Antipatterns

**Press-release formatting.** Title Case, a colon in the first line, a clean
three-clause summary. Every one of those signals institutional. Kill them.

**Over-explaining the joke.** No "lol", no "(joking)", no closing line that
restates the twist in plain terms. If it needs the explanation, the twist is
wrong. Rewrite the twist, do not add a footnote.

**Signposting that it is a joke.** "hot take:", "unpopular opinion:", "ok but
hear me out" are all wind-ups. Start at the setup.

**Arguing with people who miss it.** Some fraction will read it literally. That is
the cost of the format, not a problem to fix in the post.

**Bolting a punchline onto a sensible post.** A researched insight with a quip at
the end is a sensible post wearing a hat. The joke has to be the structure.

**Fabricating the premise to make the joke better.** If the real number is not
funny enough, the joke is wrong, not the number.

## Audit before compose_drafts

Silently, for each body:

1. Read only the first line. Does it bait, or does it announce?
2. Cover the last line. Is the setup boring and true?
3. Read the whole thing as someone who has no context. Does it still land?
4. Is every fact in it something research actually confirmed?
5. Would this read as generated? Check the universal tells; they still apply.

Fix anything that fails, then compose.
